I decided to build this project to work on my react skills while also developing a fun little game.
It was great practice in building multiple different components and bringing them all together for the final project.
MAnaging state across multiple coponents and passing them down was enjoyable to get a handle on and then linking that in with useEffect.
Overall very happy with how it turned out.

Potential future improvements: Integrate it with an api (eg pokeApi) to pull down sprites and match them instead of numbers.
